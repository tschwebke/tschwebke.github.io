      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>You can assume that your audience is the CEO and CFO of Budweiser (your client) and that they only have had one
        class in statistics and have indicated that you cannot take more than 7 minutes of their time. 20% of your grade
        will be based on the presentation.</p>
      <p>They have hired you to address the 9 questions / items described in the next section. Beyond those general
        questions you may and should speculate / anticipate what may be of interest to them.</p>

        <li>A GitHub repository (Due Saturday March 7th 11:59pm CST</li>

      <p>The GitHub repo should contain the following items and a link to the GitHub repo should be placed on a Word Doc
        (or PDF) and submitted to 2DS for Unit 8.</p>
      <p>The final repo which will be checked after 11:59pm CST March 7th should contain:</p>

      </ol>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
        <li>
          <p>The introduction needs to be written as if you are presenting the work to the CEO and CFO of Budweiser
            (your client) and that they only have had one class in statistics. If it sounds like a student presentation,
            that is not acceptable. You may assume that the CEO and CFO gave you the data and gave you the directive to
            report any interesting finding that you may uncover through your analysis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Briefly explain the purpose of the code. The explanations should appear as a sentence or two before or
            after the code chunk. Even though you will not be hiding the code chunks (so that I can see the code), you
            need to assume that the client can’t see them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use R to address the 9 questions / items below:</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>
          <p>How many breweries are present in each state?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to
            check the merged file. (RMD only, this does not need to be included in the presentation or the deck.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Address the missing values in each column.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to
            compare.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a
            scatter plot. Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India
            Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA). You decide to use KNN
            classification to investigate this relationship. Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can
            of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand
            conceptually.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this relationship (KNN is required) you may also
        feel free to supplement your response to this question with any other methods or techniques you have learned.
        Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.</p>
      <ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Knock their socks off! Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to
          find value in. You must convince them why it is important and back up your conviction with appropriate
          statistical evidence.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Directives on RMD File: i. Give clear, explicit answers to the questions. Just the code to answer the questions
        is not nearly enough, even if the code is correct and gives the correct answer. You must state the answer in a
        complete sentence outside the code chunk.</p>

            In fact, you will also upload the knit html file to GitHub as well. This will allow for plots and tables to
            supplement your answers (part e) to the 7 questions below. You are already making an Rmd file, we should
            take advantage of it and knit a nice presentation of the project!</p>

      <p>B. UNIT 8 Live Session: EDA Each team will need to meet with the professor and present their EDA in Unit 8. It
        is up to the teams and the professor when and how to set up these meetings. They may be during the schedule live
        session time, but given time constraints, some teams will need to schedule times outside of their scheduled live
        session time. With that said, these are one on one meetings between each team and the professor. Your only
        scheduled time commitment in Unit 8 is to attend this 10ish minute meeting with your professor. The rest of the
        time is reserved to work on your project with your partner. Your goal is to present your EDA (Answers to
        Questions 1,3,4,5,6,7). At this point, teams should have presentation quality slides and presentation prepared.
        Responses to each of the questions listed above should be prepared and addressed in this meeting.</p>
      <p>The grade for this portion is based on the slide deck and the presentation. If the team is prepared and
        delivers a well-practiced presentation it should be easy to earn close to a 100% here.</p>
      <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
        <li>Unit 9 Live Session: Q &amp; A.<br />
          During Live Session for Unit 9, the professor will be available for a live Q &amp; A about the project /
          presentation. Attendance at this live session is not required (attendance is optional). NOTE ABOUT POWERPOINT
          … You may use the same powerpoint or develop them separately. I would imagine that even if you develop the
          powerpoint together that each student’s final powerpoint will be a little different just based on individual
          presentation style. Everyone has their own unique style and delivery.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>C. Final YouTube Video Each team member will need to record and upload to YouTube a 7-minute or less
        presentation of your findings. At this point you should know your presentation backwards and forwards. If you
        trip up too much in your recording, you should start over until you have a very polished presentation that does
        not exceed 7 minutes.</p>
      <p>To record you can download Camtasia (free trial) which is a video software available at <a
          href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" class="uri">https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html</a>
        or use your preferred screen capture software (like QuickTime if you have a Mac.) The presentation slides that
        include a link to your video should be in the Case Study Github repo as well as on the Google Doc provided by
        your professor. The goal is to communicate the findings of the project in a clear, concise and scientific
        manner. Also, uploading to YouTube is not difficult. Here is a YouTube video to help: <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtF2AgFSLAw" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtF2AgFSLAw</a>
        Your professor will make the Google Doc link available to everyone in the class so that your peers can benefit
        from your work and so that you can benefit from theirs. Student’s presentation links will be available for a
        week at which time you may take your video off of YouTube if you wish.</p>

      <h2>Collaboration and Peer Review</h2>
      <p>This will be a team project. We expect that all team members will do equal work and give their best to advance
        the knowledge of both themselves and their teammate. All members will need to push, add, commit, and pull to
        GitHub. This is a collaborative project, be sure and communicate early and often; mutual respect is key.</p>
      <p>You will be providing two peer reviews that will be submitted to 2DS in Unit 8 and Unit 9 under: Project 1: EDA
        and Peer Review (by Saturday Feb 29 11:59pm / Unit 8) and Project 1: Final Documentation, Presentation and Peer
        Review Assignment (by Saturday March 7 11:59pm / Unit 9) . See the Rubric for detailed information on the peer
